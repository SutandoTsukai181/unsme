Latest release in: github.com/SutandoTsukai181/unsme/releases

# Changelog 2.0j:
- Added 96 format support (for JoJo models).
- You can load JoJo models for rigging, but you can NOT add vertices or else the triangles will break.
- Added 4th bone and weight support (in bone tool as well).
- Fixed an issue where you could select/unselect vertices while the bone tool is open.

# Changelog 1.75a:
- Added the old weight saving mode (for people who were used to 1.6 or previous weights).
- Added groups (/groups, /creategroup, /deletegroup, /addtogroup, /removefromgroup)
- Rewritten the entire console system. It's faster now.

# Changelog 1.7a:
- Added ortographic camera mode. When using it, you'll be able to select a region of vertices instead of using the selection sphere. Enable it with E, and then hold click to select an area of vertices. Alt + Click will deselect. It's important to do it slowly, because selecting too many vertices at the same time lags the program.
- Improved the bone editor. A prompt will appear, asking if you want the tool to search for bone names in the model. It's known to work properly in 1cmnbod1 (for adult models) and rcmnbod1 (for child models), so it's really useful. The IDs in other models might not be as accurate, so I'd recommend using the normal bone editor for the rest.
- Made the background darker (just a nitpick, but sometimes the vertices looked too similar to the background and they get mixed up).
- Fixed the saving in models with 28 of length.
- Discovered a new mesh type, with a length of 32. The tool can read those too, but saving might be weird.
- /importbones has been disabled. It brought more confusion than anything.
- Stability improved.
- Minor bugfixes.
- Added /impobjpos, in case you only modified the positions of the vertices of a model. This is really useful with models that have many groups, as it won't break the mesh.

# Changelog 1.6a:
- Obj importer has been rewritten again.
- UV mapping issue has been fixed. Model cleaner is not needed anymore.
- /importbones has been added.
- When importing .obj files, the tool will look for a .obj.bones file with the same name as the model to do an automatic /importbones.
- UI made prettier.

# Changelog 1.5a:
- 6C and 80 fix is now optional, as it fucks up meshes with multiple groups.
- Only vertices you moved get saved now, so the rest don't get fucked up.
- Minor tweaks and bugfixes.
- Herobrine removed.

# Changelog 1.4a:
- Added support for multi-grouped meshes. Most meshes should work now without breaking triangles.
- Fixed a model-breaking bug when importing low poly models.
- Fixed a few bugs when saving an .xfbin
- Stability improved

# Changelog 1.3a:
- Rewritten most of the .obj import feature
- Fixed UVs loading incorrectly in skeletonless models
- The tool now supports .obj files from basically any editor
- Errors with the tool now prompt a message box, which makes them easier to report.
- Tweaks and bugfixes.
- Performance improved.

# Changelog 1.2a:
- Byte 6C gets fixed automatically.
- Byte 80 gets fixed automatically.
- Minor tweaks and bugfixes.

# Changelog 1.1a:
- Added weight editor.

# Changelog 1.0a:
- Added export options.
- The tool can now open .unsmf decompiled models like in previous builds. They can also be saved with /saveunsmf.
- Added /closefile.
- Fixed the debug message when saving as .xfbin.

# Changelog 0.9a:
- Fixed all the size bugs.
- Added support for more texture types.

# Changelog 0.8b:
- Fixed the bug when opening files.

# Changelog 0.8a:
- You can now open and save .xfbin files directly.
- Fixed triangle bug (again. I swear, this goddamn bug keeps coming back).
- Performance improved. Opening and saving models with lots of vertices won't take as long anymore.
- Fixed resolution problems.

# Changelog 0.7a:
- Fixed the model unpacker. Now it's included with the editor.
- Fixed mirroring when exporting obj files.
- Minor bugfixes.

# Changelog 0.6a:
- Added /openstage that scales the stages automatically so you can work with them.
- Added /inverttriangles (I thought I'd done this in 0.5a already).

# Changelog 0.5a
- Added tool box.
- Added bone editor tool.
- Command /github opens github.com/zealottormunds/unsme in your browser.

# Changelog 0.4a
- Fixed a bug that changed vertex order, thus breaking all the triangles and model data. Saving should work fine now.
- Fixed /exportobj. Models are exported and imported correctly now.
- You can either use file commands with the file explorer inputting only the command (like /openmodel) or you can also input a path like in earlier versions (like /openmodel C:/modelFolder).
- Support for 32 bits.

# Changelog 0.3c
- Added command /invertnormals for lighting issues

# Changelog 0.3b
- .obj importing improved
- Added a version checker everytime the tool is started

# Changelog 0.3a
- Added file explorer instead of using PATH.
- .obj models no longer have to be divided to be imported.
- Added /rotate command
- Added /sensitivity and a configuration file.
- Added /loadtexture to reload Texture0.png
- Vertex normals get exported correclty now
- Fixed .obj texture coordinate exporting
- Fixed /scale command
- /exporttoobj has been changed to /exportobj

# Changelog 0.2a
- Removed wireframe bug

# Changelog 0.1a
- First public release
- Added vertex edition
- Added triangle edition
- Added .obj export
- Added .obj import (experimental)
